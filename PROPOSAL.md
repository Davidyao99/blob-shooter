**DESCRIPTION**
-

My final project will be a top down shooter game written in C++ and uses the Cinder 
library to display graphics for the game. The game is played with the keyboard (movement)
and mouse (for aiming and shooting). Users will be able to use a range of weopons to eliminate
a range of enemies. I chose this idea because I found game programming to be quite interesting
as it allows the programmer to interact with his code. 

**Timeline**
-

| Week | Features | 
| :---: | :--- |
| 1 | - Implement player movement mechanics|
| | - Implement player shooting mechanics and bullet animation|
| | - Implement a nice user-interface that shows game, score, health, reload status|
| 2 | - Implement enemies which are circles that spawn randomly on the peripheral of the screen|
| | - Make enemies move and follow the player|
| | - Implement collision detector of bullet with enemies and enemies with player|
| | - Make a scoring system for how many enemies killed|
| | - Increase difficulty of game as time goes on by increasing rate of spawn for enemies|
| 3 | - Implement different types of enemies with varying speed and health|
| | - Implement extra features if time permits|

**Extra Features**
- 
- Unlocking weopons after certain number of kills
- Make creative weopons such as laser, bow that requires different shooting mechanism / animation
- Make creative enemies (invinsible? bounces around?)
- High score database
- Sound effects
